# 'Neural Networks from Scratch in Python' in Elixir

Note taken while reading the book 
[Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io)
and attempting to translate the examples into the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) 
programming language, with the help of Numerical Elixir [(Nx)](https://github.com/elixir-nx)

Documented using another Elixir-Nx project, [Livebook](https://livebook.dev)


Any mistakes are my own.  Just for fun.
